# EC530 Assignment 1
Here I assumed the GPS coordinates are latitude and longitude. After some research (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/365826/calculate-distance-between-2-gps-coordinates) I found out that there is a haversine formula to get the distance. I implemented a function for this in my code, and then compared each point in the first array to the points in the second to find the closest for each, returning an array of those points.
